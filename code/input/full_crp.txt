Behind their approaches , there seems to be an assumption that grammatical constructions are not largely different among domains or do not affect parsing systems , and therefore the same parsing system can be applied to a novel domain .

In the tables , we could find that the major errors of the WSJ tagger for the Brown domains were the mis-tagging to verbs , that is , " VB \SPEC " .
From the results , we found that the main errors of the WSJ tagger for the Brown domains were mistagging of verbs , that is , " VB \SPEC " .

For Brown imperatives , the WSJ tagger gave two major tagging errors : " VB \SPEC NN( P ) " and " VB \SPEC VBP " .
For Brown imperatives , the WSJ tagger gave two main tagging errors : " VB \SPEC NN( P ) " and " VB \SPEC VBP " .
227
These two types of errors would respectively come from the following differences in sentence constructions between WSJ declarative and the Brown imperative sentences .

Firstly , declarative sentences normally begin with noun phrases while imperative sentences normally begin with verb phrases .
First , a declarative sentence normally begins with a noun phrase , whereas an imperative sentence normally begins with a verb phrase .
231
The WSJ tagger was trained on the domain mainly consisting of declarative sentences , and the training was based on N-gram sequences of words or POSs . The tagger therefore preferred to give noun phrase-derived tags to the beginning of a sentence .

Secondly , main verbs in imperative sentences take base forms while main verbs in declarative sentences take the forms according to tense .
Second , the main verb in an imperative sentence takes a base form , whereas the main verb in a declarative sentence takes a form based on tense .
235
The problem is that , for present tense except for third person singular , verbs in the declarative sentences always take the same appearances as the base forms , while the tags are different : VBP and VB .
A problem arises in that , for the present tense , except for third person singular , the verb in a declarative sentence always has the same appearance as the base form , although the tags are different : VBP and VB , respectively .
236
The WSJ tagger mainly based on declarative sentences therefore prefer to give VBP tags to main verbs .

After adapting the tagger to Brown imperatives , the N-gram model of tagger would have learned that the first word in a sentence tends to be a verb , and the main verb tends to take base form ( VB ) .

Table \REF shows that the above two types of errors did decrease to some extent . However , we can also observe that not a few mis-tags to verbs were still left after the adaptation .

243
When we observe each of the left errors around VB , we found that several errors still occurred even in simple imperative sentences such as " VB \SPEC NN " for " Charge " in " Charge something for it . " , and that some errors tended to occur after to-infinitive phrase or conjunction , such as " VB \SPEC NN " for " subtract " in " To find estimated net farm income , subtract . . . "
By investigating the remaining errors associated with VB , we found that several errors still occurred even in simple imperative sentences such as " VB \SPEC NN " for " Charge " in " Charge something for it " , and that some errors tended to occur after a to-infinitive phrase or conjunction , such as " VB \SPEC NN " for " subtract " in " To find the estimated net farm income , subtract . . .

The former type of errors might be solved by increasing the training data , while the latter type of errors would not be easily solved with the model based on word N-gram which cannot detect the existence of long phrases .

We also analyzed the errors in Brown questions and QuestionBank , and again found that the WSJ tagger seems to make many errors due to the fact that the tagger was trained on a corpus mainly consisting of declarative sentences .

After the adaptation , while some of the errors such as special usage of wh-words , i.e. , " WDT \SPEC WP " , were corrected , we found that some kinds or errors related to the global change of sentence structures still remained .

When we adapted the parser model ( see fifth column in Table \REF ) , the parser could give two to four points higher accuracies for each of the Brown domains than the WSJ parser .

When we focus on this type of errors , we could find that the WSJ parser could often make mistakes in parsing sentences which began or ended with the names of persons who were talk to .
On investigation , we found that the WSJ parser often made mistakes in parsing sentences which began or ended with the name of the person being addressed .
280
For example in Brown imperatives , for the sentence " See for yourself , Miss Zion . " , the WSJ parser regarded the person name " Zion " as ROOT , and the main verb " See " as modifiers of the name .
For example , in Brown imperatives , for the sentence " See for yourself , Miss Zion . " , the WSJ parser mistook the name " Zion " to be ROOT , and the main verb " See " to be a modifier of the name .

We also found that the WSJ parser often made mistakes in parsing sentences containing quotation , exclamation , or question marks , such as " " Hang on " !! " " or " Why did you kill it " ? ? " or " " " " .
285
For such sentences , the WSJ parser regarded the first " ! " or " ? " as ROOT , and " Hang " or " did " as the modifier of the marks .
For such sentences , the WSJ parser regarded the first " ! " or " ? " as ROOT , and " Hang " or " did " as the modifier of the punctuation .
286
We thought that this kind of errors would partly come fromthe Brown corpus itself . The exclamation or question marks should be inside the quotation , while the Brown corpus usually put the marks outside .
A possible reason for this type of error could be that the Brown corpus places exclamation or question marks outside , instead of inside the quotation .
287
However , the adapted parser could take in such doubtful construction and gave ROOT to the main verbs as the corpus required .

First , Brown imperatives and questions , include many conversation sentences , and therefore rather flexible constructions could be observed especially for imperatives , such as " Lift , don't shove lift! " , " Come out , come out in the meadow! " , etc.
First , Brown imperatives and questions , include many colloquial sentences , which have rather flexible constructions , especially imperatives , such as " Lift , don't shove lift! " , " Come out , come out in the meadow! " , etc.

Second , when the different constructions of sentences were in one sentence , such as , the case where to-infinitive phrases or subordinate clauses precede imperatives and questions , the parser would often be confused .
Second , having different sentence constructions within a single sentence , such as , where a to-infinitive phrase or subordinate clause precedes an imperative or question , often confused the parser .
296
For example , for the imperative sentence " To find estimated net farm income , subtract estimated annual farming expenditures . . . " , both of the WSJ and adapted parsers regarded " find " as ROOT , because the parsers regarded the words following " find " as a that-clause complement for the " find " , like " To find [ ( that ) estimated net farm income , subtract estimated annual farming . . .] " .
For example , for the imperative sentence , " To find the estimated net farm income , subtract the estimated annual farming expenditure . . . " , both the WSJ and adapted parsers regarded " find " as ROOT , because the parsers regarded the words following " find " as a that-clause complementing " find " , as in " To find [ ( that ) the estimated net farm income , subtract the estimated annual farming . . .] " .

It would be difficult for the parsers to know where the main clause in such complex sentences .

Imperatives or questions sentences consist not only of pure imperative or question clause , but also of other constructions of phrases or clauses .

As a result , a parser adapted to one domain could not provide correct dependency labels on functions for the other domain .
