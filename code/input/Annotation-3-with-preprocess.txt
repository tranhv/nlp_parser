Underlying these approaches , there seems to be the assumption that grammatical constructions are not largely different between domains or do not affect parsing systems , and therefore the same parsing system can be applied to a novel domain .

For example , the parsing accuracy for the Brown corpus is significantly lower than that for the Wall Street Journal ( WSJ ) portion of the Penn Treebank , even when re-training the parser with much more in-domain training data than other successful domains .

First , a declarative sentence normally begins with a noun phrase , whereas an imperative sentence normally begins with a verb phrase .

Since The WSJ tagger was trained on a domain consisting mainly of declarative sentences , with the training based on N-gram sequences of words or POSs , preference was given to noun phrase-derived tags at the beginning of a sentence .

Second , the main verb in an imperative sentence takes a base form , whereas the main verb in a declarative sentence takes a form based on tense .
Secondly , main verbs in imperative sentences take base forms while main verbs in declarative sentences take the forms according to tense .

A problem arises in that , for the present tense , except for third person singular , the verb in a declarative sentence always has the same appearance as the base form , although the tags are different : VBP and VB , respectively .

After adapting the tagger to Brown imperatives , the N-gram model of the tagger would have learned that the first word in a sentence tends to be a verb , and that the main verb tends to take the base form ( VB ) .

Thus , even though the granularity of the supersenses is sufficient for many NLP tasks , they are too coarse-grained to capture enough information for WSD models ; therefore , for the supersense-based disambiguation , we can improve the performance by considering finer-grained senses .

Although word segmentation is straight-forward for space-delimited languages like English , this is not the case for languages like Vietnamese for which a standard criterion for word segmentation does not exist .

While similar problems also occur with Chinese word segmentation ( Xia , 2000b ) , Vietnamese word segmentation may be more difficult , because the modern Vietnamese writing system is based on Latin characters , which represent the pronunciation , but not the meaning of words .

One of the reasons why the compound words are sometimes split , is because the tokens in those compound words have their own meanings , which seem to contribute to the overall meaning of the compounds .
