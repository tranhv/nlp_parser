Firstly , declarative sentences normally begin with noun phrases while imperative sentences normally begin with verb phrases .
First , a declarative sentence normally begins with a noun phrase , whereas an imperative sentence normally begins with a verb phrase .
24
Secondly , main verbs in imperative sentences take base forms while main verbs in declarative sentences take the forms according to tense .
Second , the main verb in an imperative sentence takes a base form , whereas the main verb in a declarative sentence takes a form based on tense .
25
The problem is that , for present tense except for third person singular , verbs in the declarative sentences always take the same appearances as the base forms , while the tags are different : VBP and VB .
A problem arises in that , for the present tense , except for third person singular , the verb in a declarative sentence always has the same appearance as the base form , although the tags are different : VBP and VB , respectively .

Figure \REF plots the parsing accuracy against the training data size of the four parsers for WSJ , Brown imperatives , Brown questions , and QuestionBank .
30
Note that , since training MST parser ( second order ) on Brown overall , Brown questions , and QuestionBank could not be completed in our experimental environments , the parsing accuracies represented by the bracketed hyphens in Table \REF could not be measured and we could not draw full graphs of second order MST for Brown questions and QuestionBank in Figure \REF .
Note that , since the training of the MST parser ( second order ) on Brown overall , Brown questions , and QuestionBank could not be completed in our experimental environment , the corresponding parsing accuracies denoted by bracketed hyphens in Table \REF could not be measured , Consequently , we could not plot complete graphs of second order MST for Brown questions and QuestionBank in Figure \REF .
31
When we adapted the parser model ( see fifth column in Table \REF ) , the parser could give two to four points higher accuracies for each of the Brown domains than the WSJ parser .
After adaptation ( see " Adapted " column in Table \REF ) , the parser achieved two to four percent higher accuracy for each of the Brown domains compared to the WSJ parser .
32
Figure \REF shows that , the improvements increased according to the size of the training data , and the tendencies would not seem to converge .
Figure \REF shows that the improvement is proportional to the size of the training data and that this tendency does not seem to converge .

Since ROOT dependencies , that is , heads of sentences , are critical to the construction of sentences , we focus mainly on this type of error .
36
For Brown imperatives and questions , we could observe that the reduction of ROOT dependency was prominent .
For Brown imperatives and questions , the reduction in ROOT dependencies was prominent .
37
For example in Brown imperatives , for the sentence " See for yourself , Miss Zion . " , the WSJ parser regarded the person name " Zion " as ROOT , and the main verb " See " as modifiers of the name .
For example , in Brown imperatives , for the sentence " See for yourself , Miss Zion . " , the WSJ parser mistook the name " Zion " to be ROOT , and the main verb " See " to be a modifier of the name .
38
We thought that this kind of errors would partly come fromthe Brown corpus itself . The exclamation or question marks should be inside the quotation , while the Brown corpus usually put the marks outside .
A possible reason for this type of error could be that the Brown corpus places exclamation or question marks outside , instead of inside the quotation .
39
Second , when the different constructions of sentences were in one sentence , such as , the case where to-infinitive phrases or subordinate clauses precede imperatives and questions , the parser would often be confused .
Second , having different sentence constructions within a single sentence , such as , where a to-infinitive phrase or subordinate clause precedes an imperative or question , often confused the parser .
40
For example , for the imperative sentence " To find estimated net farm income , subtract estimated annual farming expenditures . . . " , both of the WSJ and adapted parsers regarded " find " as ROOT , because the parsers regarded the words following " find " as a that-clause complement for the " find " , like " To find [ ( that ) estimated net farm income , subtract estimated annual farming . . .] " .
For example , for the imperative sentence , " To find the estimated net farm income , subtract the estimated annual farming expenditure . . . " , both the WSJ and adapted parsers regarded " find " as ROOT , because the parsers regarded the words following " find " as a that-clause complementing " find " , as in " To find [ ( that ) the estimated net farm income , subtract the estimated annual farming . . .] " .
41
This type of errors would hardly be solved only by increasing the training data .
This type of error cannot be solved merely by increasing the training data .

Imperatives or questions sentences consist not only of pure imperative or question clause , but also of other constructions of phrases or clauses .
Imperative or question sentences typically consist not only of a pure imperative or question clause , but also of other constructions of phrases or clauses .
43
The parser would parse such complex sentences without partition into each construction , and therefore it would sometimes be confused .
These complex sentences were parsed without being partitioned into separate constructions , and as a result the parser sometimes became confused .
