The second one is the approach developed by Adam Schenker and Mark Last </CITE> . 
52
In this approach , each term appearing in the document , except for stop words such as “ a ” , “ the ” , “ of ”  , “ and ” , “ or ” … which contain little information becomes a node in the graph representing the document . 
In this approach , each term appearing in the document , becomes a node , except for stop words such as “ a ” , “ the ” , “ of ”  , “ and ” , and “ or ” which contain little information . 
53

They create only a single node for each word even if a word appears more than once in the text . 
Each word is represented by only a single node even when the word appears more than once in the text . 
55
Thus each node in the graph represents a unique word . 
Thus each node in the graph represents a unique word . 
56
This node is labeled with an unique term .
For example , this is labeled with an unique term .
57
Second , if word a immediately precedes word b , somewhere in a section s of the document , then there is a directed edge from the node corresponding to a to the node corresponding to b with the label s . 
In the graph-based model , the authors create the graph by representing each word , except stop words, in the document as one unique node in the graph , regardless of how many times it appears in the text . The direction from one node to another corresponds to the relative positions of the words , and is illustrated by a directed edge starting from the node representing the preceding word . 
58
Section they have defined are as title , which contains the text related to the document ‘s title and any provided keywords; link  , which is text appearing in hyperlink on the document; and text  , which comprises any of the readable text in the document . 
The edges are then labeled according to the section that contains the words . These sections include title , link or the clickable hyperlinks , and the remaining  called text . Nodes corresponding infrequent words are excluded from the graph .

The second approach is richer than the first approach . 
The second approach is superior to the first . 
65
Suppose that we have two sentences . 
Suppose that we have two sentences : 
66
The first sentence is “ Cat eats mouse ” , the second one is “ Mouse eats cat ” . 
" Cats eat mice " and " Mice eats cats " . 
67
In the first approach , two sentences are the same meaning because it does not care the position of words in sentence . 
The first approach fails to distinguish the meanings of these sentences beacuse it ignores the positions of the words ,
68
But in second approach , these sentences are not the same meaning . 
while according to the second approach ,
69
This is true , because the position of words is expressed in the representation model . 
the word positions matter and are expressed in the representation model .
