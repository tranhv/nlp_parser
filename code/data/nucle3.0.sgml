In present days, engineers need to be creative and innovative in order to come up with new products. However, there are many problems that will hinder the engineering design process. We will focus our attention on the component decision process which will determine the type of raw materials to be used and the safety of the end product.
</P>
<P>
The cost of raw materials has risen significantly from the year 2003 to year 2009 and it has affected the electronics supply chain. We will look at two very important components in the manufacture of electronic components, gold and copper.
</P>
<P>
The price of gold has risen from about US$380/troy ounce in June 2003 to about US$960/troy ounce in June 2009 ("Trend").1 Gold is a very important component in electrical conductivity and thus often used in contact points such as the communicating interface between the graphics card and the motherboard. Hence designs that need large amount of gold may not be feasible.
</P>
<P>
Another component is copper. Copper has good electrical conductivity which allows the conductor channel lengths and widths to be significantly reduced. This results in faster operating speed and greater circuit integration. However, the price of copper has risen from about US$1900/tonne in June 2003 to about US$6200/tonne in June 2009 ("Trend").1
</P>
<P>
When engineers turn to other types of cheaper materials, some functions and accuracy of the end product may be sacrificed. However, if the engineers were to stick to their original design, the cost of the end product will be high. The high cost of the product may deter possible customers and in the end, the profit of the company will drop.
</P>
<P>
Next we will look at product safety. The main idea of safety in a product is to ensure that the utilization of the product does not cause any injury or death to the user.
</P>
<P>
One example would be the grounding of electronic devices. When electronic devices are not grounded properly, there is a probability that the user might get an electric shock when he/she accidentally come into contact with the device. If the current is very strong, there is even a chance that the user may die.
</P>
<P>
Another example would be the cases of Apple's iPhone. There are many reports around the internet and on newspaper stating that some users' iPhone exploded and the main cause is due to the overheating of the lithium- ion battery.
</P>
<P>
Lithium-ion battery has a temperature tolerance of about 60OC and anything above that will make the battery unsafe for use and in the worst case scenario; the battery explodes, causing injury or death to the user.
</P>
<P>
Hazardous product can tarnish the reputation of the company and sometimes even result in the loss of innocent lives. Thus it is very important for engineers to do repeated trial test of the product to ensure that it is free of faults.
</P>
<P>
From the points above, we can see that due to the increasing price of raw materials, it is very difficult to come up with new products consistently as it is very costly to build them. High selling price of the product will often deter potential customers and hence result in a fall of profit. Lastly, engineers must ensure that the product must be safe to use or it will end up not only spoiling the reputation of the company, it may even injure or kill someone.
