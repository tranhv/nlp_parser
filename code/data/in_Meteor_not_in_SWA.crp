34
In order to recover the tagging accuracy of the WSJ tagger for WSJ ( 97 .53\% in Table \REF ) , it would not seem to be enough only to prepare much more training data .
To match the tagging accuracy of the WSJ tagger for the WSJ ( 97 .53\% in Table \REF ) , preparing much more training data does not appear to be enough .
35
We then explored the tagging errors in each domain in order to observe what types of errors the WSJ tagger gave and what types of errors were solved or still unsolved by the adapted taggers .
Next , we explored the tagging errors in each domain to observe the types of errors from the WSJ tagger and which of these were either solved by the adapted taggers or remain unsolved .
36
In the tables , we could find that the major errors of the WSJ tagger for the Brown domains were the mis-tagging to verbs , that is , " VB \SPEC " .
From the results , we found that the main errors of the WSJ tagger for the Brown domains were mistagging of verbs , that is , " VB \SPEC " .
37
These two types of errors would respectively come from the following differences in sentence constructions between WSJ declarative and the Brown imperative sentences .
These two types of errors arise from the following differences in sentence constructions between the WSJ declarative and Brown imperative sentences .
38
Firstly , declarative sentences normally begin with noun phrases while imperative sentences normally begin with verb phrases .
First , a declarative sentence normally begins with a noun phrase , whereas an imperative sentence normally begins with a verb phrase .
39
The WSJ tagger was trained on the domain mainly consisting of declarative sentences , and the training was based on N-gram sequences of words or POSs . The tagger therefore preferred to give noun phrase-derived tags to the beginning of a sentence .
Since The WSJ tagger was trained on a domain consisting mainly of declarative sentences , with the training based on N-gram sequences of words or POSs , preference was given to noun phrase-derived tags at the beginning of a sentence .
40
Secondly , main verbs in imperative sentences take base forms while main verbs in declarative sentences take the forms according to tense .
Second , the main verb in an imperative sentence takes a base form , whereas the main verb in a declarative sentence takes a form based on tense .
41
The problem is that , for present tense except for third person singular , verbs in the declarative sentences always take the same appearances as the base forms , while the tags are different : VBP and VB .
A problem arises in that , for the present tense , except for third person singular , the verb in a declarative sentence always has the same appearance as the base form , although the tags are different : VBP and VB , respectively .
42
The WSJ tagger mainly based on declarative sentences therefore prefer to give VBP tags to main verbs .
Since the WSJ tagger is predominantly based on declarative sentences , it prefers to give VBP tags to main verbs .
43
Table \REF shows that the above two types of errors did decrease to some extent . However , we can also observe that not a few mis-tags to verbs were still left after the adaptation .
Table \REF shows that after adaptation the above two types of errors decreased to some extent , although a few mistags of verbs still remained .
44
When we observe each of the left errors around VB , we found that several errors still occurred even in simple imperative sentences such as " VB \SPEC NN " for " Charge " in " Charge something for it . " , and that some errors tended to occur after to-infinitive phrase or conjunction , such as " VB \SPEC NN " for " subtract " in " To find estimated net farm income , subtract . . . "
By investigating the remaining errors associated with VB , we found that several errors still occurred even in simple imperative sentences such as " VB \SPEC NN " for " Charge " in " Charge something for it " , and that some errors tended to occur after a to-infinitive phrase or conjunction , such as " VB \SPEC NN " for " subtract " in " To find the estimated net farm income , subtract . . . " .
45
The former type of errors might be solved by increasing the training data , while the latter type of errors would not be easily solved with the model based on word N-gram which cannot detect the existence of long phrases .
The former type could be solved by increasing the training data , whereas the latter error type cannot easily be solved with a model based on a word N-gram that cannot detect the existence of long phrases .
46
We also analyzed the errors in Brown questions and QuestionBank , and again found that the WSJ tagger seems to make many errors due to the fact that the tagger was trained on a corpus mainly consisting of declarative sentences .
We also analyzed the errors in Brown questions and QuestionBank , and again found that many errors were due to the fact that the WSJ tagger was trained on a corpus consisting mainly of declarative sentences .
47
In order to give correct tags to words both in imperatives and questions , we might have to consider richer information than only N-gram based features , such as long distance dependencies or phrases .

Table \REF gives the parsing accuracy of MST ( first order ) , MST ( second order ) , Malt , and the Enju parser for WSJ , Brown overall , Brown imperatives , and Brown questions .
49
Note that , since training MST parser ( second order ) on Brown overall , Brown questions , and QuestionBank could not be completed in our experimental environments , the parsing accuracies represented by the bracketed hyphens in Table \REF could not be measured and we could not draw full graphs of second order MST for Brown questions and QuestionBank in Figure \REF .
Note that , since the training of the MST parser ( second order ) on Brown overall , Brown questions , and QuestionBank could not be completed in our experimental environment , the corresponding parsing accuracies denoted by bracketed hyphens in Table \REF could not be measured , Consequently , we could not plot complete graphs of second order MST for Brown questions and QuestionBank in Figure \REF .
50
When we adapted the parser model ( see fifth column in Table \REF ) , the parser could give two to four points higher accuracies for each of the Brown domains than the WSJ parser .
After adaptation ( see " Adapted " column in Table \REF ) , the parser achieved two to four percent higher accuracy for each of the Brown domains compared to the WSJ parser .
51
For the QuestionBank , 25 to 35 points accuracy improvements were observed .
For QuestionBank , 25 to 35 percent improvement in accuracy was observed .
52
This would suggest that lower accuracies than the WSJ parser for WSJ would be still brought by the lack of training data .
This would suggest that lower accuracy than that of the WSJ parser for the WSJ could still be as a result of a lack of training data .
53
In Figure \REF , when we focus on the QuestionBank where we could use much more training data than Brown questions , the parser accuracies were approaching the accuracies of WSJ parser for WSJ or exceeded the accuracy .
In Figure \REF , the parser accuracy for QuestionBank , for which we could use much more training data than for Brown questions , approaches or even exceeds that of the WSJ parser for WSJ .
54
However , we have no more training data for Brown imperatives and questions . We should prepare more training data or explore approaches to enable us to sufficiently adapt parsers with small training data .
However , as there is no more training data for Brown imperatives and questions , we need to either prepare more training data or explore approaches that enable the parsers to be adapted with small amounts of training data .
55
In order to capture the outline of the adaptation effects , we observed error reduction for the Malt parser .
To capture an overview of the adaptation effects , we observed the error reduction in the Malt parser .
56
For Brown imperatives and questions , we could observe that the reduction of ROOT dependency was prominent .
For Brown imperatives and questions , the reduction in ROOT dependencies was prominent .
57
When we focus on this type of errors , we could find that the WSJ parser could often make mistakes in parsing sentences which began or ended with the names of persons who were talk to .
On investigation , we found that the WSJ parser often made mistakes in parsing sentences which began or ended with the name of the person being addressed .
58
For example in Brown imperatives , for the sentence " See for yourself , Miss Zion . " , the WSJ parser regarded the person name " Zion " as ROOT , and the main verb " See " as modifiers of the name .
For example , in Brown imperatives , for the sentence " See for yourself , Miss Zion . " , the WSJ parser mistook the name " Zion " to be ROOT , and the main verb " See " to be a modifier of the name .
59
We could also often find that the WSJ parser could often make mistakes in parsing sentences containing quotation , exclamation , and question marks , such as " " Hang on " !! " " or " Why did you kill it " ? ? " or " " " " .
We also found that the WSJ parser often made mistakes in parsing sentences containing quotation , exclamation , or question marks , such as " " Hang on " !! " " or " Why did you kill it " ? ? " or " " " " .
60
We thought that this kind of errors would partly come fromthe Brown corpus itself . The exclamation or question marks should be inside the quotation , while the Brown corpus usually put the marks outside .
A possible reason for this type of error could be that the Brown corpus places exclamation or question marks outside , instead of inside the quotation .
61
On the other hand , we also observed some still unsolved errors . We would show the two kinds of major errors among them .
On the other hand , we also observed some unsolved errors , of which we discuss two .
62
First , Brown imperatives and questions , include many conversation sentences , and therefore rather flexible constructions could be observed especially for imperatives , such as " Lift , don't shove lift! " , " Come out , come out in the meadow! " , etc.
First , Brown imperatives and questions , include many colloquial sentences , which have rather flexible constructions , especially imperatives , such as " Lift , don't shove lift! " , " Come out , come out in the meadow! " , etc.
63
Second , when the different constructions of sentences were in one sentence , such as , the case where to-infinitive phrases or subordinate clauses precede imperatives and questions , the parser would often be confused .
Second , having different sentence constructions within a single sentence , such as , where a to-infinitive phrase or subordinate clause precedes an imperative or question , often confused the parser .
64
For example , for the imperative sentence " To find estimated net farm income , subtract estimated annual farming expenditures . . . " , both of the WSJ and adapted parsers regarded " find " as ROOT , because the parsers regarded the words following " find " as a that-clause complement for the " find " , like " To find [ ( that ) estimated net farm income , subtract estimated annual farming . . .] " .
For example , for the imperative sentence , " To find the estimated net farm income , subtract the estimated annual farming expenditure . . . " , both the WSJ and adapted parsers regarded " find " as ROOT , because the parsers regarded the words following " find " as a that-clause complementing " find " , as in " To find [ ( that ) the estimated net farm income , subtract the estimated annual farming . . .] " .
65
The parser would parse such complex sentences without partition into each construction , and therefore it would sometimes be confused .
These complex sentences were parsed without being partitioned into separate constructions , and as a result the parser sometimes became confused .
66
Therefore , the parser adapted to one domain could not give correct dependency labels on such functions for the other domain .
As a result , a parser adapted to one domain could not provide correct dependency labels on functions for the other domain .
67
However , we would be able to expect that sentence constructions would be basically common and portable between two domains , which would contribute to give correct boundary for phrases and therefore the correct dependencies in phrases would be introduced by the adaptation .
However , we would expect that sentence constructions are basically common and portable between two domains , which would provide a correct boundary for phrases and therefore , the correct dependencies in phrases would be introduced by the adaptation .
68
the difference from Table \REF was that the parsers and the tagger were adapted to another question domain .
These results differ from those in Table \REF in that the parsers and the tagger have been adapted to another question domain .
69

The table shows that the parsers adapted to the Brown questions improved their parsing accuracy with QuestionBank , whereas the parsers adapted to QuestionBank decreased in accuracy .
70
With Brown questions , we could learn wh-questions which QuestionBank mainly contain , while with QuestionBank , we could not we could not learn yes-no questions which more than half of Brown corpus contain .
Using Brown questions , many wh-questions were learnt , which is what QuestionBank mainly contains . On the other hand , despite yes-no questions constituting more than half the Brown corpus , these were not learnt using QuestionBank for training .
71
This type of problem would not be noticed so much when we were working mainly on declarative sentences .
This type of problem was not so obvious when we were working mainly with declarative sentences .
72
This observation holds both for POS tagging and syntactic parsing , and itindicates that we need fundamental improvement of parsers , such as re-constructing feature designs or changing parsing models .
