The target parsers are adapted to sentences of these constructions extracted from fiction and query texts .
Analysis of the experimental results illustrates the need to handle different sentence constructions through fundamental improvement of the parsers such as re-construction of feature designs .
Parsing is a fundamental natural language processing task and essential to various NLP applications .
It excelled with English-Japanese translations , but not with Japanese-English translations .
Specifically , we assume that are strong sense dependencies between a syntactic head , and its dependents in the dependency tree , rather than between neighboring words of a sentence .
In experiments , we display the appropriateness of considering the sense dependencies , as well as the improvement of [having the result of fine- and coarse-grained tag sets .
