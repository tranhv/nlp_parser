When \MATH increases from 2000 to 10000 , the precision also increases from 74 .67\% to 81 .97\% ; meanwhile , the average rank of the first hit recommendation drops to 2 .27 from 1 .78 .

It is worth noting that keeping inreasing \MATH may not always give better precision since precision relies on not only \MATH but also the robustness of the region comparision techniques .

Recommend-Me cannot provide any hit recommendation for around 20\% of initial query images due to the fact that our region comparision technique cannot deal with significant variations of items .
